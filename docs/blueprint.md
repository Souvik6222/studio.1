## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Deep Indigo (#6639A6) to convey trust, security, and reliability.
- Background color: Light gray (#F4F4F8), almost the same hue as deep indigo but heavily desaturated, for a clean and modern look.
- Accent color: Violet (#935CC1), slightly to the left of Indigo on the color wheel, provides contrast for interactive elements and highlights.
- Body font: 'PT Sans', a humanist sans-serif providing a modern and slightly warm feel.
- Headline font: 'Playfair', a modern sans-serif lending elegance to headlines; pair with PT Sans for body text.
- Use a set of consistent icons to represent expense categories, approval status, and other key actions. Icons should be modern and clean.
- Employ a clear and intuitive layout that guides users through each step of expense submission, approval, and analysis. Use white space effectively to reduce clutter.
- Incorporate subtle animations to provide feedback, enhance usability, and create a more engaging user experience.
